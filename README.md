Until now, it takes a hardcoded json payload for events, and for a coupon, than includes those events.

Then I give it via POST method (Postman) a json payload containing user info.

All those payloads are stored in a database.

Then I query a user by his id, and a coupon by the user's id, and give them to the endpoint "coupons.html"

Finally I print on screen than the user with the specific id has the coupon with its id.

SO FAR SO GOOD
